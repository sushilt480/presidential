cisco has implemented voice vlan and how voice vlan will work together with the data vlan when you need to connect youur computer using an ip phone to the cisco switch.

cisco bent their rule between accesport versue trunk port when it comes to voice vlan.

if you put a statement such as: 
"switchport access voice vlan" on a port that port can carry two vlan which is your data vlan and the voice vlan but they claim that port still an access port that is not a trunk port.
